## Color-based Image Segmentation using K-Means clustering

**Color quantization** is a process that reduces the number of distinct colors used in an image, usually intended to still retain a visual similarity to the original image but with reduced number of colored channels. In this project, we aim to perform color quantization (or image segmentation based on colors) using a very ubiquitous unsupervised learning algorithm - **K-Means clustering**. We further aim to do better than the standard clustering algorithm by tweaking its initialization and also record comparisons between the two approaches.
